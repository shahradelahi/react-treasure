# React Treasure

React Treasure is a tool that allows you to share and store data across React components. It uses the `React Context` API to manage data.

### Installation

```bash
npm install react-treasure
```

### Usage

Before you can use the `Treasure` you need to wrap your application/parent component with the `TreasureProvider`.

```jsx
import { Provider } from 'react-treasure';

const defaultUser = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 20
};

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider initialData={{ user: defaultUser }}>
      <User />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

Here let's say we have a `User` component that has a `UserDetails` component as a child. We want to share the user data across both components.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useTreasure } from 'react-treasure';

const User = () => {
  const [userData] = useTreasure('user');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <UserDetails />
    </div>
  );
};
```

In the `UserDetails` component we want to access the user data and modify it.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useTreasure } from 'react-treasure';

const UserDetails = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useTreasure('user');

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setUser({ name: 'Jeff Bezos', age: 55 })}>Change User</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
